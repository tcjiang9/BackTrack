# Nostalgia Music App

## App Concept

### Problem

A specific song can trigger memories of high school graduation or a semester abroad. However, 

music throwbacks don’t happen often unless we hear an old song at a restaurant or something 

comes up on the radio. Even then, we may not remember what went on in the world at that time. 

How can we more intentionally trigger memories from music that incorporates aspects of a 

person’s life and events going on in the world?

### Target audience

● Interested in pop music and culture

● Nostalgic

● Uses Facebook but not necessarily super tech-savvy

### Example use case

I’m curious what happened today in history – what song was popular and what was I doing at that 

time?

### App concept

Create a pop music timeline that incorporates personal activities and world news to create a 

more holistic memory of a time.
